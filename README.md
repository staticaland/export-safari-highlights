# export-safari-highlights

A script to download highlights from Safari Books Online with totally uneccessary features and imports.

Trying out some `pipenv` and `pex` stuff.

To develop:

```
pipenv install
```

To make a PEX:

```
make pex
```

Why a silly Makefile?

> Automate to save mental energy, not time

> The same considerations apply to learning third party software. I suspect the time I’ve put into learning some features of Emacs, for example, will not pay for itself in terms of time invested versus time saved. But I’ve invested leisure time to save time when I’m working hard, not to save keystrokes but to save mental energy for the project at hand.
